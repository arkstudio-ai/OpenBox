"""Single step of the agent loop: one LLM turn and the tool calls it produces.

Split out of `loop.py` along the same seam opencode draws between
`session/prompt.ts` (the outer loop) and `session/processor.ts` (one step), for
the same reason: the loop's job is deciding *whether to keep going*, and a
step's job is *running one turn*. Interleaving them produced a single function
with nine levels of nesting that could not be exercised without a live model,
a live sandbox and a database.

The contract is deliberately narrow. A step never decides the run's fate: it
classifies what happened and returns, and the loop applies policy — retry
budgets, compaction attempts, step ceilings. Notably a retryable LLM error
comes back as RETRY with no sleeping and no counter of its own.
