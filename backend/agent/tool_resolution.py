"""Deciding which tools a step may call.

Three things happen here that used to be interleaved in the loop body: the
agent's declared toolset is looked up, tools the sandbox offers are merged in,
and anything the permission rules deny is removed *before the model sees the
schema*.

That last step is the point. Denying a tool at call time still lets the model
propose it, burn a turn and get refused; removing it from the schema means the
option never exists. Mirrors opencode's PermissionNext.disabled() feeding
resolveTools().
