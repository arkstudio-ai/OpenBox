"""Browser view: which browser the agent drives, and its live availability.

The agent can reach the web two ways. **local** is Chrome on the cloud desktop
(the sandbox), always there but carrying none of the user's logins. **remote**
is the user's own Chrome, driven through a browser extension that connects back
here — it has the real sessions, but only while the extension is connected.
**auto** (the default) prefers remote and falls back to local the moment the
extension drops.

The chosen mode is a per-user preference. Reads and writes go through
``session.browser_pref`` (it lives in the ``extra`` bag of the existing
preferences row); ``status`` reports the *effective* mode against what is
actually reachable right now, so the UI can show the live picture.
