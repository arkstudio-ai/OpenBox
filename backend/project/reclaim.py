"""Reclaiming project directories whose sessions are gone.

Directories used to accumulate forever: nothing removed them when a session was
deleted, and the WUYING provider's delete_container is a no-op, so the usual
"the container goes away eventually" safety net does not exist either.

Deleted material goes to .openbox/trash first and is removed from there on a
later pass. An agent can put hours of work in a project directory, and a
reclaim job that deletes outright turns one wrong retention setting into
permanent loss.
