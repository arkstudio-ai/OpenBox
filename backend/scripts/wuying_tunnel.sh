#
# Two hops rather than one because the desktop sits on a WUYING-managed VPC with
# no inbound route, and because a laptop running a TUN-mode proxy will happily
# swallow traffic to non-standard ports — loopback is the one address that is
# never intercepted. See docs/WUYING_SANDBOX.md.
#
# The desktop half is a systemd unit (openbox-tunnel.service) and needs no
# babysitting; only this laptop-side forward has to be started by hand.
