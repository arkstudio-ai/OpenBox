"""Session-level todo list storage.

The model rewrites the whole list on every ``todo_write`` (opencode's
full-replacement semantics), which makes duplicate items structurally
impossible. But the list has a second author — the user, who can add and
cancel items from the card — and a blind replacement would throw their
edits away every time the model spoke. So a write is a *merge*, not an
overwrite: see :func:`merge_todos` for what survives and why.

    * **Identity.** An item matched to an existing one keeps its id, so the
      UI's expand state and progress bar stay attached to the same row
      instead of resetting on every write.
    * **Start time.** ``started_at`` is stamped once, when an item first
      becomes in_progress, and then carried forward.
    * **User items.** Anything the user added stays on the list even though
      the model's replacement omits it — it has no idea it exists yet.
    * **Cancellations.** An item the user cancelled stays cancelled, even
      when the model's list still has it as pending or in_progress. The
      model is working from a stale copy; the user's veto wins until the
      model drops the item entirely.

    Matching is by subject, falling back to position — the model does not
    echo ids back, so there is nothing sturdier to match on. Rewording a
