"""view_image: let the model actually SEE an image from the sandbox.

The model runs in the backend; a screenshot or chart produced on the cloud
desktop is just a path to it. This tool pushes the file desktop → OSS with
`obx-file put` (no tunnel bytes), records it in file_assets, pins a file part
on the assistant message (the chat renders a preview card), and marks the
tool part so the next LLM call carries the image as real multimodal content
(see loop._to_llm_messages).
