# WUYING Cloud Desktop as a Sandbox

`SANDBOX_PROVIDER=wuying` runs the sandbox execution plane on an Alibaba Cloud
WUYING cloud desktop (无影云电脑) instead of a local Docker container or a
Kubernetes pod. The control plane — agent loop, permissions, event bus, the API
— still runs wherever you started the backend.

Use it when you want a persistent, full-fat Linux desktop as the agent's
workspace: it survives restarts, keeps installed tooling between sessions, and
can be attached to over the WUYING client to see what the agent did.

## Why the connection looks the way it does

Two constraints shape the whole design, and neither is obvious:

**1. The desktop has no inbound route.** It sits on a WUYING-managed VPC with a
private address (`10.x.x.x`). There is no elastic IP, no port mapping, and no
security-group rule that will expose a port on it. Outbound works fine; inbound
does not exist. So the desktop has to *dial out* to somewhere the backend can
reach — hence a relay host and a reverse tunnel.

**2. A TUN-mode proxy on the developer machine eats non-standard ports.** Many
mainland-China setups run Clash/Surge-style transparent proxying, which hijacks
all TCP below the application layer. The symptom is confusing: `nc` reports a
port as open even when nothing is listening, and an HTTP request to a
non-standard port hangs and returns nothing. `curl --noproxy` does not help,
because the interception is at the routing layer, not in curl.

Loopback is the one address such proxies never intercept. That is why the
backend talks to `127.0.0.1:18000` and a local `ssh -L` carries it out — rather
than the backend connecting to the relay's public IP directly, which would be
one fewer hop but does not survive the proxy.

The same reasoning is why `SandboxClient` passes `trust_env=False`: without it,
httpx picks up `HTTP_PROXY` from the environment and routes sandbox traffic
through the developer's proxy, which fails with an opaque timeout.

> Even so, prefer the **local `ssh -L`** shape over exposing the relay port
> publicly. Nothing is reachable from the internet, so the action server's API
> key is defence in depth rather than the only thing standing between the
> sandbox and the world.

```

The relay ECS forwards TCP and nothing else. It never holds an API key, never
sees decrypted traffic beyond what SSH carries, and its `authorized_keys` entry
for the desktop is scoped to a single forwarded port:

```
restrict,port-forwarding,permitlisten="18000" ssh-ed25519 AAAA…
```

`restrict` disables shell, agent forwarding, X11 and PTY allocation;
`port-forwarding` re-enables just the forward; `permitlisten` pins the port.

> **Gotcha:** `permitlisten="18000"` with no host means *loopback only*, and it
> silently overrides `GatewayPorts`. That is what we want here — the port must
> not be public — but if you ever do want a public bind you need
> `permitlisten="0.0.0.0:18000"` *and* `GatewayPorts clientspecified`.

## Prerequisites

| | |
|---|---|
| A WUYING desktop | Linux image. Ubuntu 22.04 is what this was built against. Note its `ecd-…` id. |
| A relay host | Any always-on host with a public IP and sshd that both the desktop and your laptop can reach. An ECS in the same account is the obvious choice. |
| `aliyun` CLI | Configured with credentials that can call `ecd` and (optionally) `ecs`. Check with `aliyun sts GetCallerIdentity`. |
| Outbound from the desktop | Package mirrors must be reachable. The bootstrap uses mainland mirrors throughout. |
| Docker on the developer machine | Builds the pinned Linux/amd64 Node 22 + HyperFrames + GSAP media bundle locally; the desktop never runs `npm install`. |
| OpenBox OSS configuration | Used as a short-lived internal transfer channel for the media bundle. The temporary object is deleted after installation. |

The bootstrap needs **no SSH credentials for either machine**: it drives the
desktop through `aliyun ecd run-command` and the relay through `aliyun ecs
RunCommand`, both of which execute as root over the cloud-assistant channel.

## Setup

### 1. Bootstrap the desktop

```bash
python backend/scripts/wuying_bootstrap.py \
    --desktop-id ecd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
    --relay root@<relay-public-ip> \
    --relay-instance i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
    --relay-region cn-hangzhou \
    --tunnel-port 18001
```

`--relay-region` is only needed when the relay ECS and desktop are in different
regions; otherwise it defaults to `--region`. Give every simultaneously active
desktop its own `--tunnel-port` so their reverse forwards cannot replace one
another on the relay.

Idempotent — re-run it to repair or upgrade a desktop. It will:

1. Create `/workspace`, `/data/skills`, `/data/mcp/logs` and the persistent and
   temporary media-job directories.
2. Upload `container/action_server.py`, `container/media_jobs.py`, the pinned
   media configuration, and the system-owned `video-production` skill under
   `/opt/openbox/skills`. Then install the Python dependencies from the
   Tsinghua PyPI mirror. The skill carries workflow instructions only; provider
   credentials remain in the backend environment.
3. Build the Linux/amd64 Node 22 + HyperFrames 0.7.94 + GSAP 3.14.2 bundle in
   local Docker, upload it as a temporary OSS object, let the desktop download
   it through the OSS internal endpoint, verify its SHA-256, and atomically
   install it under `/opt/openbox/media`. Both the local archive and temporary
   OSS object are removed afterwards.
4. Install the `dev-browser` relay and its npm dependencies. Skip with
   `--skip-dev-browser` if you do not need browser automation.
5. Generate an ed25519 key on the desktop and install
   `openbox-action-server.service` + `openbox-tunnel.service`.
6. Add the desktop's public key to the relay's `authorized_keys`, scoped as
   above. Without `--relay-instance` it prints the line for you to add by hand.

Files are shipped as gzip + base64 chunks because `run-command` caps its payload
at 16KB; `action_server.py` alone is ~85KB.

It prints a generated `SESSION_API_KEY` at the end. Keep it — the backend and the
desktop must agree on it.

### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
# backend/.env
SANDBOX_PROVIDER=wuying
WUYING_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:18000
WUYING_API_KEY=<the key the bootstrap printed>
WUYING_DESKTOP_ID=ecd-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Install the laptop's tunnel key

The laptop needs its own key on the relay, scoped to *opening* the forward
rather than *listening* on it:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -C openbox-mac -f ~/.ssh/openbox_wuying
```

Then add to the relay's `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` — via `aliyun ecs
RunCommand` if you have no SSH access:

```
restrict,port-forwarding,permitopen="127.0.0.1:18000" ssh-ed25519 AAAA… openbox-mac
```

Note `permitopen` (limits `-L` destinations), not `permitlisten` (limits `-R`
bind addresses). The desktop and the laptop need different restrictions because
they use opposite halves of the tunnel.

### 4. Open the tunnel and verify

```bash
backend/scripts/wuying_tunnel.sh          # keeps reconnecting; leave it running
curl http://127.0.0.1:18000/alive
```

A healthy response names the desktop:

```json
{"status":"ok","uptime":1319.09,"hostname":"0zd5sxxe1uw10r6","timestamp":"…"}
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SANDBOX_PROVIDER` | `docker` | Set to `wuying`. |
| `WUYING_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:18000` | Where the action server is reachable. Normally the local end of the tunnel. |
| `WUYING_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Must equal `SESSION_API_KEY` on the desktop. Empty means every request is rejected with 403. |
| `WUYING_DESKTOP_ID` | *(empty)* | `ecd-…`, informational — surfaced in logs and the container listing. |

On startup the provider calls `/alive` and logs the result. A failure is logged
loudly but does **not** abort startup, so the backend still comes up with a dead
sandbox rather than refusing to boot.

## Daily use

Only the laptop-side forward needs starting by hand:

```bash
backend/scripts/wuying_tunnel.sh
```

Everything on the desktop is systemd and self-heals across reboots:

| Unit | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openbox-action-server.service` | The execution plane on `:8000` |
| `openbox-tunnel.service` | Reverse tunnel to the relay |

The action server also owns the durable media queue. The build agent receives
the media tools from its fixed allowlist; loading `video-production` on demand
adds detailed workflow guidance only and never changes schema availability.
The queue's SQLite state lives in
`/data/openbox-media`, while per-attempt files and the reusable input cache live
under `/tmp/openbox-media`. Queue concurrency and FFmpeg threads come from
`container/media-jobs.json` (defaults: one render and four FFmpeg threads).
Linear spoken-video concatenation uses the pure-FFmpeg fast path; HyperFrames
and Chrome start only when the request explicitly selects the HTML-animation
engine.

Recommended values for the current 4-core, 8-GB-class desktop are:

| Media setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `render_engine` | `auto` | Select FFmpeg for the current linear timeline; `hyperframes` is an explicit opt-in. |
| `max_concurrency` | `1` | Other sessions remain queued and receive a queue position. |
| `output_fps` | `24` | Avoids rendering unused 30-fps frames for normal speech. |
| `ffmpeg_threads` | `4` | Uses the available CPU cores on the fast path. |
| `ffmpeg_preset` / `ffmpeg_crf` | `veryfast` / `21` | Production-speed H.264 with good short-video quality. |
| `hyperframes_workers` | `1` | Prevents multiple Chrome renderers from exhausting RAM. |
| `hyperframes_low_memory_mode` | `true` | Forces the safe low-memory profile. |
| `hyperframes_video_frame_format` | `jpg` | Appropriate for camera footage; use PNG for UI/screen recordings. |

The **dev-browser relay is not** a systemd unit. It is started on demand by
`POST /dev-browser/start` (the *Enable Dev Browser* button), and does not come
back on its own after a desktop reboot — press the button again.

## Operations

```bash
# Desktop service state
aliyun ecd run-command --api-version 2020-09-30 \
  --region cn-hangzhou --biz-region-id cn-hangzhou \
  --desktop-id "$WUYING_DESKTOP_ID" --type RunShellScript \
  --command-content 'systemctl status openbox-action-server openbox-tunnel --no-pager'

# Is the reverse tunnel actually bound on the relay?
aliyun ecs RunCommand --RegionId cn-hangzhou --InstanceId.1 <relay-instance> \
  --Type RunShellScript --CommandContent 'ss -lntp | grep 18000'

# Authenticated media queue status through the laptop tunnel
curl -H "X-API-Key: $WUYING_API_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:18000/media/jobs/status
```

Expect `127.0.0.1:18000` on the relay. `0.0.0.0:18000` means the port is exposed
publicly — check `permitlisten` and `GatewayPorts`.

To rotate the API key, set it on both sides and restart:

```bash
python backend/scripts/wuying_bootstrap.py --desktop-id … --relay … --api-key <new>
# then update WUYING_API_KEY in backend/.env and restart the backend
```

To refresh only the action server and media runtime, use the narrow deploy
script. It reuses an already healthy pinned runtime by default; pass
`--force-media-bundle` when the lockfile or Node bundle changed:

```bash
python backend/scripts/wuying_deploy_action_server.py --force-media-bundle
```

## Troubleshooting

**`WUYING sandbox unreachable at …` on startup**
The laptop-side forward is down. Start `wuying_tunnel.sh`. If it exits
immediately, the relay rejected the key — check `permitopen` in its
`authorized_keys`.

**`/alive` hangs and returns nothing, but `nc` says the port is open**
A TUN-mode proxy is intercepting. Confirm by connecting to a port where nothing
listens; if that also "succeeds", everything is being hijacked. Use the loopback
tunnel rather than the relay's public IP, and make sure nothing has reintroduced
`trust_env=True` on a sandbox HTTP client.

**Every request comes back 403**
`WUYING_API_KEY` does not match `SESSION_API_KEY` in
`openbox-action-server.service`. Re-run the bootstrap with an explicit
`--api-key` to set both.

**Tunnel is up, relay listens, but the backend still cannot reach it**
Check which address the relay bound. `permitlisten` with no host restricts the
bind to loopback, which is correct for this layout but will not serve a backend
connecting from elsewhere.

**`dev-browser not installed in container` (HTTP 500)**
The desktop was bootstrapped with `--skip-dev-browser`, or the npm install
failed. Re-run the bootstrap without that flag.

**Sandbox reachable but browser automation never connects**
`GET /dev-browser/status` should report `{"status":"running","extensionConnected":true}`.
`stopped` means nobody pressed *Enable Dev Browser* (or the desktop rebooted).
`extensionConnected: false` points at the Chrome extension — check its Server URL
under *Advanced* in the popup.

## What differs from the Docker and Kubernetes providers

| | Docker / Kubernetes | WUYING |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle | OpenBox creates and destroys containers | The desktop is provisioned out of band; `create` is idempotent, `delete`/`stop` are **no-ops** |
| Isolation | Container per user (Docker) or pod (K8s) | One shared desktop; sessions separated by `/workspace/sessions/<id>` only |
| Reachability | Local port / in-cluster service | Two-hop tunnel |
| Clean slate | Docker starts fresh each boot | State persists — installed packages, files, everything |
| Startup | Docker cleans up; K8s reconciles | Reconciles (health-checks the endpoint) |

The no-op `delete_container` matters: `SandboxManager.release()` destroys a
container once its last session ends. Left alone, that would try to delete
someone's cloud desktop.

The shared-desktop model also means **there is no isolation boundary between
users** beyond the working directory, and the action server does not constrain
paths — an absolute path escapes the session directory. Treat a WUYING sandbox
as single-tenant.
